  abstract = {Time constraint and productivity are two major things kept in mind when working on any Android project, which could not be easily achieved by the boilerplate code and innumerable exception handlers in Java. Thus, it was time to introduce a new and more mature language, which has been effectively done by JetBrains by introducing Kotlin. The paper means to address the significant portions where Java lacked as an Android programming language, and why Kotlin is going to take over Java real soon.},
